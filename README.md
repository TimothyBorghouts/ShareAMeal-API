[![Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/TimothyBorghouts/programmeren-4-shareameal/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TimothyBorghouts/programmeren-4-shareameal/actions/workflows)

## Description

This is the repository for my Share a meal API server. The API can be used by users who want to share their meals. This API contains various functionalities to provide a Share a meal application with information. This API contains, for example, users and meals that can be added, modified, viewed and deleted.

## Installation

The share a meal API can be used in 2 ways. Firstly, the share a meal api is online on a Heroku server.
[Click here to open the share a meal API on the Heroku server](https://share-a-meal-timothy-borghouts.herokuapp.com)

Secondly, it is also possible to install the share a meal server locally. This can be done by downloading the files from this repository. Then you will need Xampp and start mysql. Use a command line interface to get to the project folder and send the following texts.

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Usage

When the API is up and running you can send requests to get, change or delete data. There are several requests you can make. You will need the request, a route and sometimes information to use.

| Route             | Request |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| /api/auth/login   | POST    |
| /api/user         | POST    |
| /api/user         | GET     |
| /api/user/profile | GET     |
| /api/user/{id}    | GET     |
| /api/user/{id}    | PUT     |
| /api/user/{id}    | DELETE  |
| /api/meal         | POST    |
| /api/meal         | GET     |
| /api/meal/{id}    | GET     |
| /api/meal/{id}    | PUT     |
| /api/meal/{id}    | DELETE  |

There is documentation where you can find more information about the requests.

You will see the results that the API sends back to you. You will get different users with different information.

```
